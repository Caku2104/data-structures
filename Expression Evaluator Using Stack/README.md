# Expression Evaluator using Stack

## Overview
This project implements a **postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) expression evaluator** using a **stack data structure** in Python. It demonstrates the practical use of stacks for arithmetic expression evaluation, including handling of errors such as division by zero or invalid expressions.

---

## Features
- Supports basic arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- Handles negative numbers and floating-point numbers.
- Detects division by zero and invalid expressions.
- Provides a clean CLI output for the final result.

---

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the `expression_evaluator` folder.
2. Run the program using Python:
```bash
python main.py
```

---

## Notes

This project is intended as a practice for stack usage and understanding postfix expression evaluation.

Can be extended to support more operators or variables in the future.
